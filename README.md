# Triathlon Tools

This codebase supports a set of free tools for data-driven triathlon training and racing. You can check out the production app [here](https://triathlon-tools.vercel.app/).

## Overview

The React/Next.js app can be found in the `app/` folder. It's hosted on Vercel, and is built using components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/components).

Supporting backend code is in `python/`. Right now, all of the analysis runs client-side, but there may be a Python API to support some computations in the future.
